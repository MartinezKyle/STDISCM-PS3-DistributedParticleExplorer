## How to Run
### Java Server
- Open the `ParticleSimulationServer.jar` file in the main project folder. Or in the command line interface 
on the project main folder, use the command `java -jar ParticleExplorerServer.jar`

### C++ Client
- Make sure to have `cmake` installed.
- Run the `requirements.sh` script either by double clicking or typing `sh requirements.sh` in a gitbash terminal.
- Run the `run_cmake.sh` script file either by double clicking or typing `sh run_cmake.sh` in a gitbash terminal to compile and build the cpp program.
- Run the Client by opening the  `ClientServer.exe file` on the `./build/debug/` folder

*Notes: 
- Make sure to have the project in a directory that doesn't contain spaces as this could cause problems with the requirements.sh script.
- CMake or Visual Studio must be installed on the machine to prevent problems with the script files.

## How to Use
### Java Server
- To add a single particle, ensure that no checkbox is enabled, and that the first four fields are all filled out.
- To add multiple balls, ensure that the program is in developer mode, the checkbox beside the option is checked to be used first to enable the other input fields, and all the enabled input fields are filled out.

### C++ Client
- To spawn a sprite, click on the panel where the sprite should be placed.
- To move the sprite around the panel, use the `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys to move the sprite up, left, down, and right, respectively.


## Stopping the Program
- To stop any of the programs, close the program
